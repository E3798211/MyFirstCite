<P class = link_1_lower>
<B>My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun<BR>(Sonnet 130)<BR></B>
<BR>
My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;<BR>
Coral is much more red than her lips' red;<BR>
If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;<BR>
If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.<BR>
<BR>
I have seen roses demasked, red and white,<BR>
But no such roses I see in her cheeks;<BR>
And in some perfumes is there more delight<BR>
Than in the breath that from my mistress' reeks.<BR>
<BR>
I love to hear her speak, yet well I know<BR>
That music hath a far more pleasing sound;<BR>
I grant I never saw a goddess go;<BR>
My mistress when she walks treads on the ground.<BR>
<BR>
&emsp;&emsp;And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare<BR>
&emsp;&emsp;As any she belied with false compare.<BR>
