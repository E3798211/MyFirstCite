Some people like planes, others not. But I still have only pictures of planes, cities and a couple photographs of beaches and
I've already used lots of them in previous pages. Thats why I put this picture here. Another reason is that I simply like this photo.
<IMG src = "../photo/planes/airplane_in_the_evening_light-wallpaper-2048x1152.jpg" width = 40% align = left vspace = 6px hspace = 6px>
Isn't it enough good reason (forgive me for repeating myself) to place it somewhere? It definately fits here, doesn't it? :)

What else can I say? This is my first experience of creating something like a site. It looks interesting but real wed-designer should know a lot about how to create pictures and photos (Photoshop and oter similar and related programms), he should know JavaScript pretty well and many other things. I'm definately not going to choose the profession of wed-designer by my major occupation but it looks fun. In case I have some free time I would probably spend it on learning this subject.

Here I put some things like photographs, poetry and "pieces of music". The site looks a bit weird and boring. For example, it would be really great to cut some photos, to use pictures instead of just covering place with some color, to add some "active" objects and more music, etc, but my knowledge doesn't go too far in this subject. Anyways it is just a test probe. I've used frames, tables, CSS. Looks like a good start.

This guy has the same cards as mine. Actially, I have occasionally found this photo on my computer and placed it here. Well, it's time to end up with writing this text. It takes enough place to fill the page.

The last paragraph in here. One note: paths to pictures and the whole project architecture are weird because I'm not going to place this site anywhere except this computer. Probably I will fix it and put on GitHub later.
